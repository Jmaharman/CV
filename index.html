      Thanks for reading my C.V. and taking the time to look at the HTML of my page, you obviously
      care enough about the output of your work to warrant looking at my own.
      
      I made the original version of my C.V. using KnockoutJS. The reason was simple,
      I wanted to try something new and I wasn't worried about SEO of the site at the time.
      
      My C.V. was going to do a whole lot more, but due to time constraints (needing 
      to get it out as soon as possible so I could get work) I've had to cut back what I wanted it to do.

      One thing I will do soon is update the site so that it remembers what items you have expanded or collapsed,
      because I think it's a small annoyance that will get on peoples nerves.
      
      Thanks for your time.
      
      John
      
      Updated: 27/04/2011 to be fixed HTML and altered my profile picture.
      Updated: 29/04/2011 to work in IE6 and IE7.

          I'm a very driven, self-taught web developer who has a keen interest in a happy
          user experience and delivering a high quality product. I've had a very different
          route into the industry than most. After being a born and bred farmer until the
          age of 20, I moved into computers. Now 8 years later, I've held the position of
          Head of Digital at Avvio, which is in <a href="http://www.avvio.co.uk/News-and-blog/Growing-stronger-in-the-digital-world.aspx">

              After being at Avvio for two and a half years, our Head of Digital went on sabbatical
              for 6 months, and I was asked to take on the role while he was away temporarily
              away. After 4 months he decided that he would not return to Avvio, at which point
              I was offered the position permanently. It was with great disappointment that I
              had to decline that offer because I wanted to move back to Sussex. However I continued
              the job for an additional 4 months to ensure that my team and Avvio were prepared
              enough to carry on without me. My notice period was only a month, but I felt it
              was necessary considering my new position and the responsibility I felt towards
              my team who are also my friends.</p>

                    During the transition from Senior Developer to Head of Digital I was made line manager
                    for the rest of the team, including two digital designers and our two developers
                    (one being a contractor until my old role was filled). At first it was tricky, because
                    I would say my team were my friends more so than my colleagues. Naturally, I wondered
                    how I would balance my new duties and responsibilities with those friendships. I
                    think my approach has worked, I made sure that I was available whenever they needed
                    to talk about anything, professional or personal. I also tried not to pull weight
                    over them unless necessary, meaning that I discussed issues with them in such a
                    way that they would reach their own conclusions. On top of that I tried to encourage
                    their good work with verbal and written thanks as well as doing things like taking
                    the team out to lunch to show them our appreciation.</p>
                  <p>
                    On the side of managing the team and settling into a new role I had to recruit for
                    my old position of senior developer. I worked closely with the Studio Resource Manager
                    to make sure we found someone that had the necessary skills, mentality, personality
                    and drive. In fact, their personality and mentality were almost more important than
                    their skills, as we needed someone that would knock down barriers rather than put
                    them up.

                    Being the Head of Digital meant that I had to be more client-facing than I had been
                    previously. It was critical that I was at meetings with Account Directors or Senior
                    Account Handlers to impress clients with Avvio's technical knowledge and understanding
                    of the user's experience. As a result of this, during my time as Head of Digital
                    I was involved in pitches and many other general meetings that lead to us gaining
                    new clients and winning more work.</p>
                  <p>
                    Additionally, as part of this role I would also try to build up a relationship with
                    their internal technical teams. I found this made a massive difference in ease of
                    delivery for the project and I would recommend it for any third-party.</p>

                    An on-going job was to ensure that digital was aligned with the business' needs
                    and direction. This meant regular meetings with other heads within the business
                    to ensure that we were all agreed on what offering we could give to clients. This
                    then lead to thinking about the skills we had in the team and any additional resources
                    we had available i.e. freelancers in specific fields I could then make sure that
                    any possible jobs that came in could be dealt with in confidence, from pitch through

                    While I've been at <a href="http://wwww.avvio.co.uk/">Avvio</a> I've worked on many
                    projects, including: emails, micro-sites, intranets, distributed scheduling tools

                    The things that have excited me the most over the last two years have been Inversion

                    I've used but wouldn't put it down as a score kill, including: Git, NodeJS,

                      Sky's intranet</a> I used many different skills and abilities. Some out of necessity
                    and some through a natural learning curve.
                  </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>The site was hosted internally at Sky, so as a third-party we only had access
                      to one of their testing servers. Originally only being deployed via a zip file,
                      the deployment process was improved over time by creating simple to use installers.
                    </li>
                    <li>I was often contacted directly by the client, either to discuss new features /
                      ideas that he may have. If a bug appears on the site, he will often speak to me
                      directly so that we can resolve the issue as quickly as possible for him. </li>
                    <li>Working with Sky's internal development team use to be a difficult experience.
                      We improved this relationship by involving them as early on as possible in the update
                      process, including them in testing and asking their opinions on functionality. We
                      also made strides to build a more personal relationship between the two teams by
                      bringing them together over lunch to discuss the project and other aspects of our
                      work. </li>
                    <li>Sky's intranet was created using a, no longer supported, code generation template
                      for data access, a no longer supported. I decided that the best approach to take
                      on the site's continued development and evolution without a re-write was to start
                      using NHibernate for new features and to gradually move across the old features
                      as necessary. </li>
                    <li>Some features, such as integration into other systems internally, would have been
                      tricky for us to implement. Instead, we created container areas so that Sky's development
                      team could plugin their own features to enhance the site. </li>

                    for additional man power or specialist skills when required. This means that we
                    couldn't always use the very latest technology because finding contractors last
                    minute that could do those skills was either very difficult or very costly.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I would say the biggest technical changes I made at Avvio were; moving from SourceSafe
                    to Subversion, .NET framework 2.0 to 3.5, and starting to work on a new set of libraries
                    to help speed up development of features that were created time and time again.
                    I also setup
                    <abbr title="Continuous Integration">
                      CI</abbr>
                    for less friction during the development lifecycle, this also had the bonus that
                    contractors didn't need to be shown how to deploy to our test servers.

                    were due to start building the booking system mentioned above. I was asked to teach

                    to help start build their new booking system. The system had already been planned
                    by the development manager, but not to a huge amount of detail. As a result, we
                    frequently had to use our own common sense because we were often mapping loose ideas

              and to a high standard. It was during this five week period that I was offered a

                    I worked closely with Laina, the owner of <a href="http://www.fineartcompany.co.uk/">
                      The Fine Art Company</a>, to plan the site. We had to make sure that we had both
                    the user's needs and the administrator's needs were met. Laina then used our plan
                    and objectives to come up with designs, these designs were then tweaked to take
                    on board some best practice advice from myself.</p>
                  <p>
                    I then got to work on the site, building it using ASP.NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005.
                    It was not built on top of any already existing e-Commerce site because I thought
                    that her needs were too bespoke to try shoehorning into the way another e-Commerce
                    site worked. However, if I'm honest, I always used to think that a bespoke build
                    was the best solution, but now I think that isn't always the case. There are so
                    many different options available, either as a bought product or open source, that
                    it's fairly likely one of those options will fit the needs of the client, which
                    in the long run will save time and money.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I built the site using progressive enhancements so that the site was as accessible
                    as possible. I had to integrate the site into Mal's eCommerce for the payment gateway
                    because the client decided that they wanted to continue to using it, as it had worked
                    so well for them previously. The site was delivered within the deadline of 1.5 months
                    and has had a few updates since. I'm proud to say that there have been zero front
                    end updates and as far as I know everything still renders well in all browsers.

          Sports and exercise</h5>
        <p>
          I have an overall interest in keeping fit, generally through a variety of sports
          including running, cycling and football.</p>

        <h5>
          Programming</h5>
        <p>
          I love programming. I like it so much that I do it at home for fun and to learn.
          I read a variety of industry related books in my spare time, including subjects
          like best practices, technology specific (Lucene.NET, ASP.NET MVC) or even design
          principles. That's not to mention the various blogs I get feeds from, which these
          days has decreased due to the use of Twitter but is still a valuable resource for
          me. I also like to go to events like <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ddd">
            #ddd</a> or get-togethers like <a href="http://readinggeeknight.com">Reading Geek
              night</a>.</p>

        <h5>
          More knowledge</h5>
        <p>
          Here's a quick list of things that I have looked at briefly but want to get more
          involved in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Node</li>
          <li>RavenDB</li>
          <li>OpenWrap</li>
          <li>OpenRasta</li>
          <li>BDD - SpecFlow</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I can see real value in using each of the above technologies in different situations,
          so I'd like to know about them so I can judge when they are best suited.</p>
