    <!--
    Thank you for reading my C.V. and also taking the time to look at the source code. 
    
    The reason I made my primary CV online was because I felt writing a CV in word 
    was dull for both me and my readers, so why not harness my skills to make
    it more interesting and usable.

    One of my main objectives was to make the CV as easily scannable as possible. I came
    to that decision because I always found monumental word CVs too time consuming to read
    through properly. I would always start skimming a CV and then move into more
    detail if I found them to be worthwhile. So I've tried to make that task easier for you.

    I intend to add features over time so that we use the power of the web 
    to make things even easier, such as a skill filter. See == History == for update nodes.

    Thanks for your time.

    John

    P.S. For a more detailed description of how this page is generated using Node.Js and Less please visit

    == History ==

    07/12/2012: Updated the packages to use the latest version of NodeJs. Included the package.json file so it's easier to include on clones.
    Fixed a few issues that occured because of the upgrade such as a breaking change in expressjs. Updated the CV content itself.

    27/04/2012: I've recently added a more visual representation of myself, hopefully this will be the first
    step in making a more intuitive way of browsing my CV. The graph is an enhancement that's only visible
    on modern browsers that support Canvas. I have no requirement to support older browsers as I think the types
    of clients I wish to work for would be using the best browsers available.

    19/04/2012: Re-created my CV so that it was generated via Node.js and Mustache as well as using Less. 

    April 2011: Originally created my online CV in KnockoutJS as a tester for learning the technology. I actually found
    I didn't like using it because it tried to do too much. In the end I used it to generate an HTML page from XML in Javascript
    but then had to save it to another HTML file so that search engines could find it. I was not happy with the state of my CV but had
    no time to improve it any further at the time.
