    <!--
    Dear Sir / Madam,

    Thank you for reading my C.V. and also taking the time to look at the source of the page. 
    Hopefully you will like what you see and possibly agree with the reasons 
    why I decided to create my C.V. in this format.

    Firstly you get the opportunity to look through my code, and make 
    your own judgements before you even talk to me.

    Secondly, in my role at Avvio I was constantly looking through C.V.s and like
    most people I found it tiring reading so much unecessary information 
    for what was often a quick scan which I would then go into detail. 
    So I've tried to make my C.V. as easy to scan as easily as possible so you can find
    the information you are looking for.

    Thanks for your time.

    John

    P.S. The site is built by generating the page using a mustache and XML data. 
    The CSS is generated using LESS and I have also added some enhancements to
    the page via Javascript to make your life easier as you browse the page. 
    I have deliberately left the site unminified and uncompressed so that you could read it easily.
    However to view my original CSS you should check my repo with my cv: https://github.com/Jmaharman/CV 
    basically I don't agree like the way LESS puts each selector on its own line.

              <p> I'm a very driven, self-taught web developer who has a keen interest in good user experiences and delivering a product that is as useful to the user, as it is maintainable for the developer. </p> <p>As a born and bred farmer until the age of 20 I didn't have access to computers regularly until I was 17 which is when I found that I loved using them. When I was about 18 I started creating websites for family and friends which is when I taught myself HTML, Javascript and PHP. </p> <p> A lot has changed since then, I've now got over 8 years of experience in website development, working on both backend and frontend in numerous platforms and technologies. Along with that experience you get a very passionate and personable developer who believes strongly that good communication is the key to success. </p>

                                        <p>Historically the intranet, mobile intranet and extranet are threee different websites. The intranet is managed by the Internal Communications team for staff that worked on site at Sky or over a VPN and was created by Avvio. The extranet was managed by the Supply Chain for engineers out in the field so that they could get the latest news, it was also created by Avvio. The mobile intranet was managed by Internal Communications but created by Sky's internal mobile team. It allowed staff that had a windows BSKYB login to access the intranet content while they were outside the network on their mobile, tablet or desktop.</p> <p>In an internal re-shuffle Supply Chain became part of Internal Communications, this created the opportunity to streamline the communications process to all staff of Sky as well as opening the possibility to enabling comments and likes to anyone that was able to view the content on either website. The main tasks of the brief were:</p> <ul> <li>Allow content to be published via the intranet CMS onto individual or all three sites. Including being able to only show to particular sub user groups in each site if necessary</li> <li>can handle sharing of images and videos that are used in the article</li> <li>should be resilliant enough to handle connection down time and continue as usual</li> <li>any comments or likes made from either site would be available on all others almost immediately</li> <li>the site was to be moved onto a new environment which included two load balanced web servers and a clustered SQL server</li> </ul> <p>I was involved in all meetings once the project was started, often going into Sky to speak with the clients, who I have always had a good relationship with due to working with them for 3 years previously. After the initial development and testing period I worked at Sky HQ to ensure that the code was functioning correctly and performing satisfactorily. This meant I worked with Sky's <abbr title="Corporate Applications Development">CADM</abbr> team and their performance testing team over a two week period until all were satisfied.</p> <p>The above is only a synopsis of the main work that occured on this phase of the project, there is more but we can discuss that in person. The project was delivered on time and is in production as we speak.</p>

I came into this project after the initial editing tool was created and helped to improve it by adding more functionality.

                        <div class="position-details">
                        <p>After being at Avvio for two and a half years, our Head of Digital went on sabbatical for 6 months, and I was asked to take on the role while he was away temporarily away. After 4 months he decided that he would not return to Avvio, at which point I was offered the position permanently. It was with great disappointment that I had to decline that offer because I wanted to move back to Sussex. However I continued the job for an additional 4 months to ensure that my team and Avvio were prepared enough to carry on without me. My notice period was only a month, but I felt it was necessary considering my new position and the responsibility I felt towards my team who are also my friends.</p>

                                        <p>During the transition from Senior Developer to Head of Digital I was made line manager for the rest of the team, including two digital designers and our two developers (one being a contractor until my old role was filled). At first it was tricky, because I would say my team were my friends more so than my colleagues. Naturally, I wondered how I would balance my new duties and responsibilities with those friendships. I think my approach has worked, I made sure that I was available whenever they needed to talk about anything, professional or personal. I also tried not to pull weight over them unless necessary, meaning that I discussed issues with them in such a way that they would reach their own conclusions. On top of that I tried to encourage their good work with verbal and written thanks as well as doing things like taking the team out to lunch to show them our appreciation.</p> <p>On the side of managing the team and settling into a new role I had to recruit for my old position of senior developer. I worked closely with the Studio Resource Manager to make sure we found someone that had the necessary skills, mentality, personality and drive. In fact, their personality and mentality were almost more important than their skills, as we needed someone that would knock down barriers rather than put them up. </p>

                                        <p>Being the Head of Digital meant that I had to be more client-facing than I had been previously. It was critical that I was at meetings with Account Directors or Senior Account Handlers to impress clients with Avvio's technical knowledge and understanding of the user's experience. As a result of this, during my time as Head of Digital I was involved in pitches and many other general meetings that lead to us gaining new clients and winning more work.</p> <p>Additionally, as part of this role I would also try to build up a relationship with their internal technical teams. I found this made a massive difference in ease of delivery for the project and I would recommend it for any third-party.</p>

If a bug appears on the site, he will often speak to me directly so that we can resolve the issue as quickly as possible for him. </li> <li> Working with Sky's internal development team use to be a difficult experience. We improved this relationship by involving them as early on as possible in the update process, including them in testing and asking their opinions on functionality. We also made strides to build a more personal relationship between the two teams by bringing them together over lunch to discuss the project and other aspects of our work. </li> <li> Sky's intranet was created using a, no longer supported, code generation template for data access, a no longer supported. I decided that the best approach to take on the site's continued development and evolution without a re-write was to start using NHibernate for new features and to gradually move across the old features as necessary. </li> <li> Some features, such as integration into other systems internally, would have been tricky for us to implement. Instead, we created container areas so that Sky's development team could plugin their own features to enhance the site. </li> </ol>

                                        <p> Avvio use a model whereby the core digital team is small but is bolstered by contractors for additional man power or specialist skills when required. This means that we couldn't always use the very latest technology because finding contractors last minute that could do those skills was either very difficult or very costly. </p> <p> I would say the biggest technical changes I made at Avvio were; moving from SourceSafe to Subversion, .NET framework 2.0 to 3.5, and starting to work on a new set of libraries to help speed up development of features that were created time and time again. I also setup <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> for less friction during the development lifecycle, this also had the bonus that contractors didn't need to be shown how to deploy to our test servers. </p>

Laina then used our plan and objectives to come up with designs, these designs were then tweaked to take on board some best practice advice from myself.</p> <p> I then got to work on the site, building it using ASP.NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005. It was not built on top of any already existing e-Commerce site because I thought that her needs were too bespoke to try shoehorning into the way another e-Commerce site worked. However, if I'm honest, I always used to think that a bespoke build was the best solution, but now I think that isn't always the case. There are so many different options available, either as a bought product or open source, that it's fairly likely one of those options will fit the needs of the client, which in the long run will save time and money. </p> <p> I built the site using progressive enhancements so that the site was as accessible as possible. I had to integrate the site into Mal's eCommerce for the payment gateway because the client decided that they wanted to continue to using it, as it had worked so well for them previously. The site was delivered within the deadline of 1.5 months and has had a few updates since. I'm proud to say that there have been zero front end updates and as far as I know everything still renders well in all browsers. </p>

                        <h3>Web Designer / Web Developer @ Friday-Ad</h3>
                        <p>Period: <strong>May 2004 - Jan 2007</strong></p>
                        <div class="position-details">
                        <p>I started working at Friday-Ad as one of their two web designers. As time went on my role changed into a full-time developer, mostly due to my interest and keenness in learning things like CSS, ASP, ASP.NET (VB and C#) and SQL Server while on the job. Towards the end of my time at Friday-Ad I was often mentoring others and was asked to work on a few of their higher profile sites.</p>

                                        <p>I originally designed various websites, emails and basic banners. Eventually I was given the opportunity to design the main Friday-Ad website. Although designing is not my main skill, I still believe I have a good eye for design.</p>

                                        <p>Although Friday-Ad owns a lot of different websites, their busiest site was <a href="http://www.friday-ad.co.uk">www.friday-ad.co.uk</a>. One of the main reasons for this was because of the amount of content on it and that the fact that this content was easily found through search engines. SEO changes that were put into place by myself and our SEO consultants were the reason for this. My part in this process was to plan and update the website so that search engines could index the different categories and results for specific areas, therefore targeting local content. This system worked so well that it was only replaced in 2010.</p>

                    <p>I love programming. I like it so much that I do it when I get home as well. I read a variety of industry related books in my spare time, including subjects like best practices, technology specific (Lucene.NET, ASP.NET MVC) or even design principles. That's not to mention the various blogs I get feeds from, which these days has decreased due to the use of Twitter but is still a valuable resource for me. I also like to go to events like <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ddd">#ddd</a> or get-togethers like <a href="http://readinggeeknight.com">Reading Geek night</a>.</p> <p>I would like to start contributing to an open source project but so far this has been minimal. I'm hoping that the more I use git and Github the more likely this will happen.</p>
