              <p>
                  I'm a very driven, self-taught web developer who has a keen interest in good user experiences and delivering a 
                  product that is as useful to the user, as it is maintainable for the developer. </p>
              <p>As a born and bred farmer until the age of 20 I didn't have access to computers regularly until
                  I was 17 which is when I found that I loved using them. When I was about 18 I started creating websites for family and friends
                  which is when I taught myself HTML, Javascript and PHP.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot has changed since then, I've now got over 8 years of experience in website development, working on both backend and frontend in 
                numerous platforms and technologies. Along with that experience you get a very passionate and personable developer who believes strongly
                that good communication is the key to success.

                  The things that I mention below are all areas or skills that I believe are important in what I do but I feel I'm weaker than I want to be.
                  I'm working on improving them all the time though:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Git - although I use it on my own personal projects I haven't had the opportunity to use it in the work place, which I think will help improve my understanding and usage of it.</li>
                    <li>TDD - I've never used it in any workplace, I've done it myself at home but feel that I need a working environment to really embed this in my head</li>
                    <li>Unit testing javascript - I'm currently trying to make this part of my working process</li>

                  I'm interested in any contract role that involves development using .NET 3.5+ or heavy frontend development. I am happy to lead or be part of a team and
                  I'm keen to be involved in all parts of a projects lifecycle.

                        <title>Intranet, mobile intranet and extranet integration</title>
                        <description><![CDATA[<p>Historically the intranet, mobile intranet and extranet are three different websites. The intranet is managed by the Internal Communications team 
                            for staff that worked on site at Sky or over a VPN and was created by Avvio.
                            The extranet was managed by the Supply Chain for engineers out in the field so that they could get the latest news, it was also created by Avvio. The mobile intranet
                            was managed by Internal Communications but created by Sky's internal mobile team. It allowed staff that had a windows BSKYB login to access the intranet content
                            while they were outside the network on their mobile, tablet or desktop.</p>
                            <p>In an internal re-shuffle Supply Chain became part of Internal Communications, this created the opportunity to streamline the communications process
                            to all staff of Sky as well as opening the possibility to enabling comments and likes to anyone that was able to view the content on either website.
                            The main tasks of the brief were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Allow content to be published via the intranet CMS onto individual or all three sites. Including being able to only show to particular sub user groups in each site if necessary</li>
                                <li>can handle sharing of images and videos that are used in the article</li>
                                <li>should be resilliant enough to handle connection down time and continue as usual</li>
                                <li>any comments or likes made from either site would be available on all others almost immediately</li>
                                <li>the site was to be moved onto a new environment which included two load balanced web servers and a clustered SQL server</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I was involved in all meetings once the project was started, often going into Sky to speak with the clients, who I have always had a good relationship with
                                due to working with them for 3 years previously. After the initial development and testing period I worked at Sky HQ to ensure that the code was functioning correctly and performing satisfactorily. This meant I worked with Sky's <abbr title="Corporate Applications Development">CADM</abbr> team and their performance testing team over a two week period until all were satisfied.</p>
                            <p>The above is only a synopsis of the main work that occurred on this phase of the project, there is more but we can discuss that in person. The project was delivered
                            on time and is in production as we speak.</p>

                            steps had been completed the user was informed if they had enough study time booked in or if it need to be adjusted. If the study time was correct it then analyzed their plan and if necessary would suggest other tips to help them, e.g. splitting up study blocks if study sessions were too long.</p>]]></description>

                <story><![CDATA[<p>After being at Avvio for two and a half years, our Head of Digital went on sabbatical for 6 months, 
                and I was asked to take on the role while he was away temporarily away. After 4 months he decided that he would not return to Avvio,
    at which point I was offered the position permanently. It was with great disappointment that I had to decline that offer 
    because I wanted to move back to Sussex. However I continued the job for an additional 4 months to ensure that my team and 
    Avvio were prepared enough to carry on without me. My notice period was only a month, but I felt it was necessary considering my new position 
    and the responsibility I felt towards my team who are also my friends.</p>]]></story>

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>During the transition from Senior Developer to Head of Digital 
                        I was made line manager for the rest of the team, including two digital designers and our two developers (one being
                        a contractor until my old role was filled). 
                        At first it was tricky, because I would say my team were my friends more so than my colleagues. 
                        Naturally, I wondered how I would balance my new duties and responsibilities with those friendships. 
                        I think my approach has worked, I made sure that I was available
                        whenever they needed to talk about anything, professional or personal. I also tried not to 
                        pull weight over them unless necessary, meaning that I discussed issues with them in such a way that
                        they would reach their own conclusions. On top of that I tried to encourage their good work with verbal 
                        and written thanks as well as doing things like taking
                        the team out to lunch to show them our appreciation.</p> 
                        <p>On the side of managing the team and settling into a new role I had to recruit for my old position of senior developer. 
                        I worked closely with the Studio Resource Manager to make sure we found
                        someone that had the necessary skills, mentality, personality and drive. In fact, their personality and mentality
                        were almost more important than their skills, as we needed someone that would knock down barriers 
                        rather than put them up.

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>Being the Head of Digital meant that I had to be more client-facing than I had been previously.
                        It was critical that I was at meetings with Account Directors or Senior Account Handlers to impress clients with Avvio's
                        technical knowledge and understanding of the user's experience. As a result of this, during my time as Head of Digital 
                        I was involved in pitches and many other general meetings that lead to us gaining new clients and winning more work.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, as part of this role I would also try to build up a relationship with their internal technical teams. I found this made
                        a massive difference in ease of delivery for the project and I would recommend it for any third-party.</p>]]></description>

                        aligned with the business' needs and direction. This meant regular meetings with other heads
                        within the business to ensure that we were all agreed on what offering we could give to clients.
                        This then lead to thinking about the skills we had in the team and any additional resources we had available 
                        i.e. freelancers in specific fields
                        I could then make sure that any possible jobs that came in could be dealt with in confidence, from pitch through to delivery.</p>]]></description>

                    <a href="http://www.avvio.co.uk">Avvio</a> is a small company comprised of roughly 40 employees.
                    This meant that as Senior Developer (with the only other developer being a flash developer,) I was involved in projects
                    in many different ways, such as brainstorming, client meetings, requirements gathering, estimates, planning, 
                    hardware specifications, development, management, working closely with client

                            While I've been at <a href="http://wwww.avvio.co.uk/">Avvio</a> 
                            I've worked on many projects, including: emails, micro-sites, intranets, distributed scheduling tools 
                            and our own internal libraries such as a search tool.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During these projects I've taught myself all of the libraries found below and have used techniques 
                            that I have read about in books, online or by going to 
                            <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ddd">Developer Developer Developer</a>
                            and finding out about the latest new technology. The things that have excited me the most over the last
                            two years have been Inversion of Control, NHibernate and Lucene.NET, not to mention a few things recently that
                            I haven't had a chance to use at work but I have tinkered with, including: NodeJS, 
                            KnockoutJS, Razor view engine and OpenWrap.

                        <p>
                            While working on 
                            <a href="http://www.avvio.co.uk/Our-Work/Sky/Faster-information-means-more-productive-people.aspx?skillnm=Intranets">Sky's intranet</a>
                            I used many different skills and abilities. Some out of necessity and some through a natural learning curve.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                The site was hosted internally at Sky, so as a third-party we only had access to one of their testing servers.
                                Originally only being deployed via a zip file, the deployment process was improved over time by
                                creating simple to use installers.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I was often contacted directly by the client, either to discuss new features / ideas that he may have. 
                                If a bug appears on the site, he will often speak to me directly so that we can resolve the issue
                                as quickly as possible for him.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Working with Sky's internal development team use to be a difficult experience.
                                We improved this relationship by involving them as early on as possible in the update process, 
                                including them in testing and asking their opinions on functionality. 
                                We also made strides to build a more personal relationship between the two teams by bringing 
                                them together over lunch to discuss the project and other aspects of our work.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Sky's intranet was created using a, no longer supported, code generation template for data access, a no longer supported. I decided that
                                the best approach to take on the site's continued development and evolution without a re-write was to 
                                start using NHibernate for new features and to gradually move across the old features as necessary.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Some features, such as integration into other systems internally, would have been tricky 
                                for us to implement. Instead, we created container areas so that Sky's development team could plugin 
                                their own features to enhance the site.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                        <p>
                            Avvio use a model whereby the core digital team is small but is
                            bolstered by contractors for additional man power or specialist skills when required. This means that we couldn't
                            always use the very latest technology because finding contractors last minute that could do
                            those skills was either very difficult or very costly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would say the biggest technical changes I made at Avvio were; moving from SourceSafe to Subversion, 
                            .NET framework 2.0 to 3.5, and starting to work on a new set of libraries 
                            to help speed up development of features that were created time and time again. I also setup
                            <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> for less friction during the development lifecycle,
                            this also had the bonus that contractors didn't need to be shown how to deploy to our test servers.

                        who were due to start building the booking system mentioned above. 
                        I was asked to teach them the basics of ASP.NET and go through solutions to simple scenarios that they
                        frequently came up against.

                        However, it was quickly evident that they had not touched upon
                        <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> before and that they had a lot to learn. To aid

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>After giving the day's training course I was asked to come on as part of the team to
                        help start build their new booking system. The system had already been planned by the development manager, but
                        not to a huge amount of detail.
                        As a result, we frequently had to use our own common sense because we were often
                        mapping loose ideas to the way that pages from an older system had worked.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If I was to work on this contract again I would get the team to review each other's code
                            far more often. This did happen, but only really when helping each other.
                            If it was made part of the daily cycle the quality of the code would have been better
                            and knowledge of the system would have been shared more evenly.

                        the site and also tidied up the use of HTML, which was semantically very wrong in a few places, e.g.
                        strong being used as header tags. I did it far quicker than expected and
                        quickly moved onto other tasks that needed doing, such as fixing bugs on already existing administrative pages,
                        creating new features such as an audit trail, and adding polls to the site</p>]]></description>

                        We we're given the brief, page designs and part of the database structure. We then had to work through

                        output much cleaner HTML using some MVC framework and I would use Lucene.NET

                the old site page by page in an HTML editor and uploading this to their server. This meant that their
                site took up a lot of administrative time, lacked consistency, and that changing simple things like VAT across the
                entire site would have been a nightmare.

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>I worked closely with Laina, the owner of 
                        <a href="http://www.fineartcompany.co.uk/">The Fine Art Company</a>,
                        to plan the site. We had to make sure that we had both the user's needs and the administrator's needs
                        were met. Laina then used our plan and objectives to come up with designs, 
                        these designs were then tweaked to take on board some best practice advice from myself.</p>
                        <p>
                            I then got to work on the site, building it using ASP.NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005. It was not built
                            on top of any already existing e-Commerce site because I thought that her needs were too bespoke to try 
                            shoehorning into the way another e-Commerce site worked. 
                            However, if I'm honest, I always used to think that a bespoke build was the best
                            solution, but now I think that isn't always the case. There are so many different
                            options available, either as a bought product or open source, that it's fairly likely 
                            one of those options will fit the needs of the client,
                            which in the long run will save time and money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I built the site using progressive enhancements so that the site was as accessible as possible.
                            I had to integrate the site into Mal's eCommerce for the payment gateway because the client decided 
                            that they wanted to continue to using it, as it had worked so well for them previously. The site was delivered
                            within the deadline of 1.5 months and has had a few updates since. I'm proud to say that there have been
                            zero front end updates and as far as I know everything still renders well in all browsers.

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>Although Friday-Ad owns a lot of different websites, their busiest
                        site was <a href="http://www.friday-ad.co.uk">www.friday-ad.co.uk</a>. One of the main reasons for this 
                        was because of the amount of content on it
                        and that the fact that this content was easily found through search engines. 
                        SEO changes that were put into place by myself and our SEO 
                        consultants were the reason for this. My part in this process was to plan and update the website so that 
                        search engines could index the different
                        categories and results for specific areas, therefore targeting local content. 
                        This system worked so well that it was only replaced in 2010.</p>
