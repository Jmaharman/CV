              <p>
                  I'm a very driven, self-taught web developer who has a keen interest in good user experiences and delivering a 
                  product that is as useful to the user, as it is maintainable for the developer. </p>
              <p>As a born and bred farmer until the age of 20 I didn't have access to computers regularly until
                  I was 17 which is when I found that I loved using them. When I was about 18 I started creating websites for family and friends
                  which is when I taught myself HTML, Javascript and PHP.
              </p>
              <p>
                A lot has changed since then, I've now got over 9 years of experience in website development, working on both backend and frontend in 
                numerous platforms and technologies. Along with that experience you get a very passionate and personable developer who believes strongly
                that good communication is the key to success.
              </p>
              <p>
                My more recent aim has been to become a programmer who is ubiquitous in whatever platform / technology available. There are obviously restrictions to what one man can do but I believe the more I know about other systems and other languages the better a programmer I become.

                <p>While creating this project in PHP I've been using a lot of MVC design patterns to make my code as testable and de-coupled as possible. This also meant that I've learned a lot of the newer features available in PHP 5.4+ which has led me to think that PHP isn't as bad as I used to think.</p>]]></story>

However I can say that it was a showcase site providing information and interaction to keep the user interested as they went through the site. The site was created with touch screen devices in mind so we could use the native features on the device to give the user the best experience possible. I can show this when meeting in person if interested.</p>]]></description>

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>Channel 4's Paralympic website was already up, however a new design along with new features was already well under development. My main role was to help them ensure an ontime and smooth delivery. This entailed learning and using their in-house CMS which is specifically designed for sporting events. I wouldn't say that the role was technically challenging but I did have to learn a lot very quickly to get everything rolling. The sort of work I was doing was:</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Creating web pages and includes using XML and XSLT.</li>
                                <li>Working with Channel 4's accessibility agency to ensure the site was accessible to at least AA standard, this also entailed using screenreaders such as JAWS for testing.</li>
                                <li>Enhancing clunky features, an example would be the schedule which I managed to fixed the headers to make everything more visible while still being accessible.</li>
                                <li>Ensuring the website HTML validated as much as possible, there were some scenarios that this was not possible due to accessibility features actually breaking full validation.</li>
                                <li>Generally discussing usability issues with the team to see what we could do to make it a better experience for the user.</li>

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>British Gas are the main sponsors of the GB Swimming team and wanted to spread the word internally about who the team is while trying to get them excited about their part in the Olympics. British Gas have touchscreen pods at most of their locations around UK, these were updated with three different swimming oriented games and information on the team. When a user completed the game they had the chance to enter for a prize draw afterwards. The system ran within Chrome Kiosk mode which meant we could use the latest HTML5 and Javascript features to create the best experience possible. The project itself only had two and a half weeks until deadline which we met with almost half a day spare.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Swimming game: three.js was used to create a 3D-esq retro style game where users had to dodge randomly dropped obstacles that became more frequent as time moved on.</li>
                                <li>Snap: three.js was used to create a simple snap game where the swimming team would be used on the cards that the users had to match.</li>
                                <li>Create an avatar: Users could create their own swimming avatar by dragging different clothing and accessories onto the model. A screenshot was then taken of the user's avatar with Canvas and stored locally on the machine for later retrieval.</li>
                                <li>About the team: Users could watch video on each of the four main swimming hopefuls in the GB team</li>

                        <title>Intranet, mobile intranet and extranet integration</title>
                        <description><![CDATA[<p>Historically the intranet, mobile intranet and extranet are three different websites. The intranet is managed by the Internal Communications team 
                            for staff that worked on site at Sky or over a VPN and was created by Avvio.
                            The extranet was managed by the Supply Chain for engineers out in the field so that they could get the latest news, it was also created by Avvio. The mobile intranet
                            was managed by Internal Communications but created by Sky's internal mobile team. It allowed staff that had a windows BSKYB login to access the intranet content
                            while they were outside the network on their mobile, tablet or desktop.</p>
                            <p>In an internal re-shuffle Supply Chain became part of Internal Communications, this created the opportunity to streamline the communications process
                            to all staff of Sky as well as opening the possibility to enabling comments and likes to anyone that was able to view the content on either website.
                            The main tasks of the brief were:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Allow content to be published via the intranet CMS onto individual or all three sites. Including being able to only show to particular sub user groups in each site if necessary.</li>
                                <li>Can handle sharing of images and videos that are used in the article.</li>
                                <li>Should be resilliant enough to handle connection down time and continue as usual.</li>
                                <li>Any comments or likes made from either site would be available on all others almost immediately.</li>
                                <li>The site was to be moved onto a new environment which included two load balanced web servers and a clustered SQL server.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>I was involved in all meetings once the project was started, often going into Sky to speak with the clients, who I have always had a good relationship with
                                due to working with them for 3 years previously. After the initial development and testing period I worked at Sky HQ to ensure that the code was functioning correctly and performing satisfactorily. This meant I worked with Sky's <abbr title="Corporate Applications Development">CADM</abbr> team and their performance testing team over a two week period until all were satisfied.</p>
                            <p>The above is only a synopsis of the main work that occurred on this phase of the project, there is more but we can discuss that in person. The project was delivered
                            on time and is in production as we speak.</p>

This helped to create a system that could be used as it was or one that could be easily be extended for any requirements.

    at which point I was offered the position permanently. It was with great disappointment that I had to decline that offer 
    because I wanted to move back to Sussex. However I continued the job for an additional 4 months to ensure that my team and 
    Avvio were prepared enough to carry on without me. My notice period was only a month, but I felt it was necessary considering my new position 
    and the responsibility I felt towards my team who are also my friends.</p>]]></story>

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>During the transition from Senior Developer to Head of Digital 
                        I was made line manager for the rest of the team, including two digital designers and our two developers (one being
                        a contractor until my old role was filled). 
                        At first it was tricky, because I would say my team were my friends more so than my colleagues. 
                        Naturally, I wondered how I would balance my new duties and responsibilities with those friendships. 
                        I think my approach has worked, I made sure that I was available
                        whenever they needed to talk about anything, professional or personal. I also tried not to 
                        pull weight over them unless necessary, meaning that I discussed issues with them in such a way that
                        they would reach their own conclusions. On top of that I tried to encourage their good work with verbal 
                        and written thanks as well as doing things like taking
                        the team out to lunch to show them our appreciation.</p> 
                        <p>On the side of managing the team and settling into a new role I had to recruit for my old position of senior developer. 
                        I worked closely with the Studio Resource Manager to make sure we found
                        someone that had the necessary skills, mentality, personality and drive. In fact, their personality and mentality
                        were almost more important than their skills, as we needed someone that would knock down barriers 
                        rather than put them up.

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>Being the Head of Digital meant that I had to be more client-facing than I had been previously.
                        It was critical that I was at meetings with Account Directors or Senior Account Handlers to impress clients with Avvio's
                        technical knowledge and understanding of the user's experience. As a result of this, during my time as Head of Digital 
                        I was involved in pitches and many other general meetings that lead to us gaining new clients and winning more work.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, as part of this role I would also try to build up a relationship with their internal technical teams. I found this made
                        a massive difference in ease of delivery for the project and I would recommend it for any third-party.</p>]]></description>

                        aligned with the business' needs and direction. This meant regular meetings with other heads
                        within the business to ensure that we were all agreed on what offering we could give to clients.
                        This then lead to thinking about the skills we had in the team and any additional resources we had available 
                        i.e. freelancers in specific fields
                        I could then make sure that any possible jobs that came in could be dealt with in confidence, from pitch through to delivery.</p>]]></description>

                            and finding out about the latest new technology. The things that have excited me the most over the last

                            KnockoutJS, Razor view engine and OpenWrap.

                                The site was hosted internally at Sky, so as a third-party we only had access to one of their testing servers.
                                Originally only being deployed via a zip file, the deployment process was improved over time by
                                creating simple to use installers.

                                I was often contacted directly by the client, either to discuss new features / ideas that he may have. 
                                If a bug appears on the site, he will often speak to me directly so that we can resolve the issue
                                as quickly as possible for him.

                                Working with Sky's internal development team use to be a difficult experience.
                                We improved this relationship by involving them as early on as possible in the update process, 
                                including them in testing and asking their opinions on functionality. 
                                We also made strides to build a more personal relationship between the two teams by bringing 
                                them together over lunch to discuss the project and other aspects of our work.

                                Sky's intranet was created using a, no longer supported, code generation template for data access, a no longer supported. I decided that
                                the best approach to take on the site's continued development and evolution without a re-write was to 
                                start using NHibernate for new features and to gradually move across the old features as necessary.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Some features, such as integration into other systems internally, would have been tricky 
                                for us to implement. Instead, we created container areas so that Sky's development team could plugin 
                                their own features to enhance the site.
                            </li>
                        </ol>

                            Avvio use a model whereby the core digital team is small but is
                            bolstered by contractors for additional man power or specialist skills when required. This means that we couldn't
                            always use the very latest technology because finding contractors last minute that could do
                            those skills was either very difficult or very costly. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I would say the biggest technical changes I made at Avvio were; moving from SourceSafe to Subversion, 
                            .NET framework 2.0 to 3.5, and starting to work on a new set of libraries 
                            to help speed up development of features that were created time and time again. I also setup
                            <abbr title="Continuous Integration">CI</abbr> for less friction during the development lifecycle,
                            this also had the bonus that contractors didn't need to be shown how to deploy to our test servers.

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>I was asked to come in and give a day's tuition to two full time developers
                        who were due to start building the booking system mentioned above. 
                        I was asked to teach them the basics of ASP.NET and go through solutions to simple scenarios that they
                        frequently came up against.
                        </p>
                        <p>I tried to teach what I considered to be best practices when programming in ASP.NET

                        However, it was quickly evident that they had not touched upon
                        <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">OOP</abbr> before and that they had a lot to learn. To aid
                        their learning I created a very small example application that they
                        could refer to during their development.</p>]]></description>

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>After giving the day's training course I was asked to come on as part of the team to
                        help start build their new booking system. The system had already been planned by the development manager, but
                        not to a huge amount of detail.
                        As a result, we frequently had to use our own common sense because we were often
                        mapping loose ideas to the way that pages from an older system had worked.

                            If I was to work on this contract again I would get the team to review each other's code
                            far more often. This did happen, but only really when helping each other.
                            If it was made part of the daily cycle the quality of the code would have been better
                            and knowledge of the system would have been shared more evenly.

                        strong being used as header tags. I did it far quicker than expected and
                        quickly moved onto other tasks that needed doing, such as fixing bugs on already existing administrative pages,

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>I worked closely with Laina, the owner of 
                        <a href="http://www.fineartcompany.co.uk/">The Fine Art Company</a>,
                        to plan the site. We had to make sure that we had both the user's needs and the administrator's needs
                        were met. Laina then used our plan and objectives to come up with designs, 
                        these designs were then tweaked to take on board some best practice advice from myself.</p>
                        <p>
                            I then got to work on the site, building it using ASP.NET 2.0 and SQL Server 2005. It was not built
                            on top of any already existing e-Commerce site because I thought that her needs were too bespoke to try 
                            shoehorning into the way another e-Commerce site worked. 
                            However, if I'm honest, I always used to think that a bespoke build was the best
                            solution, but now I think that isn't always the case. There are so many different
                            options available, either as a bought product or open source, that it's fairly likely 
                            one of those options will fit the needs of the client,
                            which in the long run will save time and money.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I built the site using progressive enhancements so that the site was as accessible as possible.
                            I had to integrate the site into Mal's eCommerce for the payment gateway because the client decided 
                            that they wanted to continue to using it, as it had worked so well for them previously. The site was delivered
                            within the deadline of 1.5 months and has had a few updates since. I'm proud to say that there have been
                            zero front end updates and as far as I know everything still renders well in all browsers.

                <story><![CDATA[<p>I started working at Friday-Ad as one of their two web designers. As time went on my role changed
                into a full-time developer, mostly due to my interest and keenness in learning things like CSS, 
                ASP, ASP.NET (VB and C#) and SQL Server while on the job. Towards the end of my time at Friday-Ad I was often mentoring others 
                and was asked to work on a few of their higher profile sites.</p>]]></story>

                        <description><![CDATA[<p>I originally designed various websites, emails and basic banners. Eventually I was given
                        the opportunity to design the main Friday-Ad
                        website. Although designing is not my main skill, I still believe I have a good eye for design.</p>]]></description>

                        <title>SEO updates on www.Friday-Ad.co.uk</title>
                        <description><![CDATA[<p>Although Friday-Ad owns a lot of different websites, their busiest
                        site was <a href="http://www.friday-ad.co.uk">www.friday-ad.co.uk</a>. One of the main reasons for this 
                        was because of the amount of content on it
                        and that the fact that this content was easily found through search engines. 
                        SEO changes that were put into place by myself and our SEO 
                        consultants were the reason for this. My part in this process was to plan and update the website so that 
                        search engines could index the different
                        categories and results for specific areas, therefore targeting local content. 
                        This system worked so well that it was only replaced in 2010.</p>

Snowboarding is another love of mine and I'm going to be forfilling a dream of living on the mountain for three months in Whistler this season (2012).</p>]]></description>

                <description><![CDATA[<p>I love programming. I like it so much that I do it when I get home as well.
                I read a variety of industry related books in my spare time, including subjects like best practices, 
                technology specific (Lucene.NET, ASP.NET MVC) or even design principles. That's not to mention the various blogs I get feeds
                from, which these days has decreased due to the use of Twitter but is still a valuable resource for me. 
                I also like to go to events like <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23ddd">#ddd</a> 
                or get-togethers like <a href="http://readinggeeknight.com">Reading Geek night</a>, <a href="http://asyncjs.com/">async</a> or <a href="http://brightonalt.net/">alt.net beers</a>.</p>
                <p>I would like to start contributing to an open source project but so far this has been minimal. I'm hoping that the more
                    I use git and Github the more likely this will happen.</p>]]></description>

                <p>Here's a quick list of things that I have looked at briefly but want to get more involved in: 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Node.js</li>
                    <li>NoSql, specifically RavenDB or MongoDB</li>
                </ul>
                <p>I can see real value in using each of the above technologies in different situations, so I'd like to know about them
                so I can judge when they are best suited.</p>
