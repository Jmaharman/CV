CV
==

My CV in it&#39;s raw format, when the Node generator is run Mustache templates are combined with XML to output my HTML page. I also use LESS to generate my CSS so it is more maintainable.

How it works
===
Run generator.js with node and the CV HTML will be generated. While the command is open and no errors occur you will be able to amend any of the main files and refresh the browser to see the changes due to a watch being placed on all important files.
